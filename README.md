# AI Chess opponent
AI chess opponent that plays reasonably well against humans and that I enjoy playing against (~1900 ELO)

The engine has 4 modes: random, minimax with piece valuation, minimax with custom piece evaluation heuristics + positional evaluation heuristic, alphabeta pruning. The engine is fully playable through the [Jupyer Notebook](https://github.com/RisticDjordje/ai-chess-engine/blob/main/ai_chess_engine.ipynb).

The notebook contains a more detailed explanation of the project.
